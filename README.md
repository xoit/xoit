## My Experience

It follows Design, Cad, and Architecture. I wass in Physical Design team to do the **Place & Route** for many years.
Then I moved to CAD team for flow methodology and infrastructure building.

- I was doing small design (digital part in Analog IP) to large SoC (mobile SoC block and top)
- I was developing APR utilities and project work automation
- I was architecting the ASIC design platform and serving different teams and projects.

I like sharing and grow with the team.
